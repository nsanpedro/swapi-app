# Qu Challenge! :computer:

#### 1. How to run the app? :pencil::

- Download or clone repo.
- Navigate to `swapi-app` folder. Then run `yarn install`
- Once package installation finished, run `yarn start` to get front end running.
- Go to `localhost:3000` in the browser.

###### :books: User Flow:

- User starts in the `HOME` page, and is able to navigate to `PEOPLE` or `PLANETS` page.
- In the `PEOPLE` or `PLANETS` page, User should see the data fetched paginated, displaying some specific data inside the card.
- In the `PEOPLE` or `PLANETS` page, User can sort data alphabetically, and navigate from the either page to other routes.

###### :heavy_plus_sign: Things I would've liked to add:

- A checkbox filter functionality in addition to sorting.
- Add unit testing to the app.
- Have a better design proposal.

Thank you for the opportunity! :smile:
